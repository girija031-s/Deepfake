Smart Banking Authentication System

---

##  What is this?

Multi-layer verification is used in this AI-powered authentication prototype to protect online banking from **deepfakes, voice spoofing, and bot attacks

---

##  Key Features

 **Deepfake Detection** – Face liveness & spoof detection
**Voice Biometrics** – Detects synthetic & replay attacks
**Behavioral Biometrics** – Tracks typing & interaction patterns
**Risk Engine** – Generates real-time trust score
**Admin Console** – Monitor sessions & fraud attempts
**Explainable AI** – Shows *why* access is allowed/blocked
**Attack Simulation Mode** – Demo real fraud scenarios

---

##  How it Works

Face → Voice → Behavior → Risk Analysis → Decision

---

##  Outcome

✔ Secure Login
⚠ OTP Verification
🚫 Fraud Blocked

---

##  Tech Stack

* ⚛ Frontend: React
* 🎨 UI: Tailwind CSS
* 🎬 Animations: Framer Motion

---

##  Why it Stands Out

👉 Continuous AI trust verification** 
👉 Identifies contemporary threats like deepfake and AI voice cloning 
👉 Transparent + real-time decision system
